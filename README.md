# Daily-Planner

Very happy with how this assignment turned out! Everything should work as it should which includes typing content into the textareas and being able to save it to the local storage!
There is also an active timer and the current hour is shown by red, past is grey, and future is green

# What I learned

* jquery is easier than javascirpt

* How to create active day and active live clock

* How to keep time within the active textarea

# Motivation for Creation

who doesnt want an online planner you don't have to pay $5 a month for
